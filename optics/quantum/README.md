# Wave-Particle Duality of Light

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the fundamental quantum mechanical principle that light exhibits both wave and particle properties, depending on how it's observed and measured. This concept revolutionized physics in the early 20th century and laid the foundation for quantum mechanics.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### Wave Nature of Light üåä

1. **Interference** - When two or more light waves overlap, they can add constructively (bright spots) or destructively (dark spots), creating interference patterns.

2. **Diffraction** - Light waves bend around obstacles and through apertures, with smaller openings causing more pronounced bending.

3. **Reflection & Transmission** - Light waves partially reflect and transmit at interfaces between materials, following Fresnel equations.

4. **Dispersion** - Different wavelengths of light refract by different amounts, separating white light into colors (like in a prism).

### Particle Nature of Light ‚öõÔ∏è

5. **Photoelectric Effect** - Light behaves as discrete energy packets (photons) that can knock electrons out of materials, but only if the photon energy exceeds a threshold.

6. **Photon Energy** - Light consists of particles called photons, each carrying energy E = hf = hc/Œª, where h is Planck's constant.

7. **Compton Scattering** - When high-energy photons collide with electrons, they behave like particles, transferring momentum and changing wavelength.

8. **Complementarity** - Light exhibits either wave or particle behavior in a given experiment, never both simultaneously.

## Historical Significance

This duality was discovered through key experiments:
- **Young's Double Slit** (1801): Demonstrated wave nature through interference
- **Einstein's Photoelectric Effect** (1905): Showed particle nature, won Nobel Prize
- **Compton Scattering** (1923): Confirmed photon momentum and particle behavior

The wave-particle duality is fundamental to understanding modern quantum mechanics and has enabled technologies from computers to medical imaging.
